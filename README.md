# Restaurant Data Analytics
A restaurant analytics project using real world restaurant data to guide business decision making

### Business Questions

**Main**
1. What are the top selling products and worst selling products within a given time range?
2. How do certain events affect product sale in terms of quantity sold?
    * Holidays and special events
    * New menu and price changes
    * Social media activity
    * Lockdowns and quarantine
3. Is there a correlation between month of the year to quantity sold for a certain product?
4. Does season or even weather affect product sales?
    * Do certain products go up/down/stay neural in quantity sold during X season/weather? 
    * How does the change in sale or lack thereof compare to the year and the whole dataset?
5. Some products aren't in the menu anymore, is it possible that the removal of these products were badly decided in terms of how these products were selling during their lifetime?
6. Determine price elasticity - understand customersâ€™ sensitivity to price changes
7. Is it possible build a model that can reliably predict product sales?

**Advanced**
1. Of all top n best selling products, how many are also being sold in top rated restaurants (of similar cuisine) 
    * in the local area
    * in the country

#### Implications
* Menu optimisation
* Stock optimisation
* Save money
* Understand the business better
